# Day-15-Coffee-Machine
A coin operated coffee machine

A coffee machine that only accepts quarters,nickels, dimes and pennies.

You can choose between an Espresso $1.50 , a Latte $2.50 and a Cappuccino $3.00.

Be careful tho, the coffee machine has limited resources and can't provide you endless cups of coffee.

Don't try to cheat the machine by giving insufficient amount of money either.

TODO 1. Ask users what they want

TODO 2. if they answer 'off' terminate the program

TODO 3. if they answer 'report' give a report of the remaining resources

TODO 4. if they answer any listed coffee, minus it from the resources

TODO 5. bill them: ask for quarters,dimes,nickels,pennies. Minus the price from the sum and give them change

TODO 6. add the price to the money resources.

TODO 7. if there's not enough resources for the coffee or insufficient money is given, report, refund and keep running the program.
